						<p>
							At TechnologyAdvice, I built a modular, accessible
							carousel component as a custom Gutenberg block for
							deployment across a large portfolio of full-site
							editing (FSE) WordPress properties with distinct
							brands. Designed to be theme-agnostic and highly
							configurable, it empowered content creators to add
							and customize carousels without developer
							supportâ€”while ensuring code maintainability, optimal
							performance, and a consistent user experience.

							Key Features
						</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Modular architecture:</strong> The
								carousel block was built as a reusable,
								extensible Gutenberg component, compatible
								across all FSE-enabled themes in the company web
								portfolio.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Custom UI controls:</strong> Block
								controls for toggling navigation, pagination,
								autoplay, slide count, spacing, and
								breakpointsâ€”all easily managed from the
								WordPress block editor.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Accessibility-first design:</strong>{' '}
								Splide.js was selected for its lightweight build
								and out-of-the-box accessibility support (ARIA,
								keyboard nav), which aligned with WCAG 2.1
								standards.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Performance conscious:</strong> Avoided
								heavy dependencies and built only what was
								needed. Styles and scripts were enqueued
								conditionally to avoid front-end bloat.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Reusable content structure:</strong>{' '}
								Content inside each slide was made
								flexibleâ€”users could insert images, text,
								buttons, or even other custom blocks.
							</li>
						</ul>

							Challenges &amp; Solutions
						</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Problem:</strong> Most carousel plugins
								didnâ€™t play nicely with Gutenberg, were lacking
								desired features, and added unnecessary weight.
								<br />
								<strong>Solution:</strong> Built a block suite
								from scratch, leveraging Splide.js only for core
								functionality, and created a modular React-based
								editor interface for flexibility and future
								enhancements.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Problem:</strong> Making the block
								compatible across multiple FSE themes with
								different global styles and layouts.
								<br />
								<strong>Solution:</strong> Used scoped styles,
								CSS variables, and a config-driven approach to
								ensure the block respected theme-specific
								constraints while remaining consistent.
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h2 className='text-xl font-semibold mb-1'>Impact</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Improved editorial workflow:</strong>{' '}
								Empowered content teams to build rich,
								interactive experiences with no developer input
								required.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Reduced plugin bloat:</strong> Replaced
								several site-specific carousel implementations
								with a single unified block, cutting maintenance
								overhead.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Enhanced UX:</strong> Improved mobile
								performance and accessibility metrics across
								several key landing pages where the block was
								deployed.

			<p className='text-lg mb-4'>
				{' '}
				a web software developer who loves turning ideas into
				accessible, responsive, and thoughtfully crafted web
				experiences.{' '}
				<strong>
					I bring a creative and detail-oriented eye, a growth
					mindset, and a strong sense of curiosity to every project I
					touch.
				</strong>
			</p>
			<p className='text-lg mb-4'>
				I‚Äôm currently based in üìç Kingston, NY and open to remote or
				NYC-area hybrid roles. I‚Äôm especially drawn to mission-driven
				organizations that prioritize equity and public impact‚Äîteams
				where clean code and inclusive collaboration go hand-in-hand
				with purposeful work.
			</p>
			<p className='text-lg mb-4'>
				My journey into tech followed more than 15 years in leadership,
				management, and customer-facing roles in restaurants and
				grocery. That chapter of my career shaped my commitment to
				people-first values:{' '}
				<strong>
					clear communication, deep empathy, and creative
					problem-solving.
				</strong>{' '}
				I made the pivot into web development with a vision of building
				tools and experiences that are truly useful, accessible, and
				rooted in inclusion.
			</p>
			<p className='text-lg mb-4'>
				My technical toolkit includes JavaScript, TypeScript, React,
				Next.js, Vue, and WordPress (including custom Gutenberg block
				development). I also have experience deploying and monitoring
				containerized sites using tools like AWS and ArgoCD. Whether I‚Äôm
				engineering scalable design systems or implementing
				accessibility best practices, I aim to build thoughtful,
				maintainable solutions that reflect care for both users and
				teams.
			</p>
			<p className='text-lg mb-4'>
				Outside of tech, I‚Äôm a hobbyist woodworker with a love for
				interior design, a good TV binge, and immersive, story-rich
				video games. I live with my wife and our two dogs, Astrid and
				Ty, and I‚Äôm always hunting for the best sandwiches.

				<strong>Let‚Äôs build something meaningful together.</strong>

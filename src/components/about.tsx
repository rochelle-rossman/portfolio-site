				ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Rochelle â€” a web developer who loves turning ideas into
				accessible, responsive, and thoughtfully crafted web
				experiences. I bring a creative eye, a detail-oriented mindset,
				and a strong sense of curiosity to every project I touch.
			</p>
			<p className='mb-4'>
				My journey into tech began after over a decade in leadership and
				customer-facing roles, where I developed a strong foundation in
				communication, empathy, and collaborative problem-solving. I
				made the pivot into web development to build tools that are both
				useful and inclusiveâ€”and that mission still guides my work every
				day.
			</p>
			<p className='mb-4'>
				Most recently at TechnologyAdvice, I led high-impact projects
				like migrating 20+ legacy WordPress sites to AWS, improving site
				performance by over 40%, and modernizing editorial workflows
				with block-based Full Site Editing. I also worked on a
				multi-site headless CMS migration, developed real-time Vue
				features in a WordPress plugin, and built localization tools to
				support global growth.
			</p>
			<p className='mb-4'>
				My technical toolkit includes JavaScript, TypeScript, React,
				Next.js, Vue, and WordPress (including custom Gutenberg block
				development). Iâ€™m comfortable with tools like Tailwind, Vite,
				Storybook, Splide.js, Docker, and GitHub Actions. I also have
				experience deploying and monitoring containerized sites using
				AWS, Datadog, and Argo CD. Whether Iâ€™m solving performance
				bottlenecks, designing scalable component systems, or
				implementing accessibility best practices, Iâ€™m always focused on
				building reliable, maintainable solutions.
			</p>
			<p className='mb-4'>
				Iâ€™m currently based in Kingston, NY and open to remote or
				NYC-area hybrid roles. Iâ€™m especially interested in joining a
				mission-driven org or product team that values clean code,
				creative problem-solving, and inclusive collaboration.
			</p>
			<p className='mb-4'>
				Outside of tech, Iâ€™m a hobbyist woodworker with a love for
				interior design, a good TV binge, and immersive, story-rich
				video games. I live with my wife and our two dogs, Astrid and
				Ty, and Iâ€™m always hunting for the best pastry in town. Letâ€™s
				build something great together.

				Hi, I’m Rochelle 👋 — a front-end-focused web developer with a
				passion for clean code, intuitive interfaces, and
				performance-first thinking.
			</p>

			<p className='mb-4'>
				I made my way into tech after years in leadership and creative
				roles at Trader Joe’s, where I blended visual communication with
				customer care. That background shaped how I build today: with
				empathy, collaboration, and clarity.
			</p>

			<p className='mb-4'>
				I’ve built scalable WordPress components, led site rebuilds from
				Figma to production, migrated legacy stacks to modern
				infrastructure, and created systems that empower non-technical
				teams to do more with less dev involvement.
			</p>

			<p className='mb-4'>
				When I’m not coding, you can find me hiking the Hudson Valley,
				reading sci-fi, or experimenting with new recipes. I’m always
				eager to learn and grow, whether it’s through side projects,
				community events, or just diving into the latest tech trends.
			</p>

				<span className='text-3xl font-semibold'>👋 I’m Rochelle</span>{' '}
				<br /> — a web developer who loves turning ideas into
				accessible, responsive, and thoughtfully crafted web
				experiences. I bring a creative and detail-oriented eye, a
				growth mindset, and a strong sense of curiosity to every project
				I touch.
			</p>
			<p className='mb-4'>
				My journey into tech began after over a decade in leadership and
				customer-facing roles, where I developed a strong foundation in
				communication, empathy, emotional intelligence, and
				collaborative problem-solving. I made the pivot into web
				development to build tools that are both useful and
				inclusive—and that mission still guides my work every day.
			</p>
			<p className='mb-4'>
				Most recently at TechnologyAdvice, I led high-impact projects
				like migrating 20+ legacy WordPress sites to AWS, improving site
				performance by over 40%, and modernizing editorial workflows
				with block-based Full Site Editing. I also worked on a
				multi-site headless CMS migration, developed real-time Vue
				features in a WordPress plugin, and built localization tools to
				support global growth.
			</p>
			<p className='mb-4'>
				My core technical toolkit includes JavaScript, TypeScript,
				React, Next.js, Vue, and WordPress (including custom Gutenberg
				block development). I have experience deploying and monitoring
				containerized sites using tools like AWS and ArgoCD. Whether I’m
				engineering scalable component systems, or implementing
				accessibility best practices, I’m always focused on building
				reliable, maintainable solutions.
			</p>
			<p className='mb-4'>
				I’m currently based in 📍 Kingston, NY and open to remote or
				NYC-area hybrid roles. I’m especially interested in joining a
				mission-driven orginization or product team that values clean
				code, creative problem-solving, and inclusive collaboration.
			</p>
			<p className='mb-4'>
				Outside of tech, I’m a hobbyist woodworker with a love for
				interior design, a good TV binge, and immersive, story-rich
				video games. I live with my wife and our two dogs, Astrid and
				Ty, and I’m always hunting for the best pastry in town. Let’s
				build something great together.
